What is the definition of innovation?
The definition of innovation has been debated for years and there is no definitive answer. In general, innovation refers to a new approach to something or a new way of doing something. Innovations have the potential to change the way people live and work, and can even improve the quality of life for those who use them. However, there are some key elements that must be satisfied in order for an innovation to be considered successful: it needs to be novel, it needs to be affordable, it needs to be accessible, it needs to be viable, and it needs to be safe.

How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when trying to be creative?
Creativity is a skill that can be used in many ways, but ultimately it comes down to a few things: being creative, taking risks, and having an idea for something. A lot of people try to do too much when it comes to creativity, and they end up with nothing new or interesting come out. It's important to limit yourself and work on just one or two ideas at a time so you can better focus on the task at hand. And always be open to new ideas - no matter how weird or unusual they may seem!
