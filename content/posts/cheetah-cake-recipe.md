Origins of creativity: How has creativity emerged over time, and what reasons do we have for expecting it to continue to grow?
Creativity has been around for a while, and there are several reasons why we think it will continue to grow. One reason is that creativity is oftenasured in terms of what can be done, rather than what is possible. For example, in architecture, the goal is to create something beautiful and unique, not to solve a problem. This focus on beauty means that architects can often come up with really creative ideas that don't solve any problems. Another reason why creativity will continue to grow is because humans are constantly learning. We constantly learn new things and try new things, so our minds are constantly evolving and growing more creative.

Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.

Conclusion: Some final thoughts on creative ideas.
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to reach your target audience or developing a new marketing strategy, creativity is always key to success. Here are some final thoughts on creative ideas: 
1. Make sure your ideas are relevant to your target audience. If you don’t know what your target audience is, you won’t be able to come up with ideas that will capture their attention. 
2. Be sure to think outside the box. Sometimes the best way to get people’s attention is to do something they haven’t seen before. Be sure not only to come up with original ideas, but also find ways to market them successfully. 
3. Take advantage of online tools and resources.
