How to come up with great ideas?
Ideas can be everything from creative to helpful, and they come in all shapes and sizes. To come up with great ideas, it's important to think outside the box. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Try different methods: When you have a good idea, don't just sit down and write it down. You might want to try thinking about it from a different perspective or using different language.

2. Get feedback: Take some time to get feedback from people who know what you're trying to do. They might have some great ideas of their own that you can use as a starting point.

3. Be open to change: If your idea is great, but it's not working for someone else, don't be afraid to make changes.

How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.
