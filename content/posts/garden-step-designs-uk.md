The consequences of having big ideas?
Many people believe that having big ideas is essential to creativity and innovation. However, the consequences of having big ideas can be very costly and time-consuming. For example, a company may spend years developing a new product but if its idea is not accepted by the market, the company may lose its revenue and potential customers. Additionally, it can be difficult to find backers for big projects and even harder to get the word out about them. When a company has a large idea, it can often become overshadowed by other more pressing challenges.
