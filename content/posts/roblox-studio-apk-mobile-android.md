The 5 Big Ideas of Creativity
Creativity is an important concept in our lives. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to find solutions to problems. Here are five big ideas of creativity: 1. One can be creative when they are thinking out loud – this means that they are not just focusing on one thing. They are brainstorming and working on multiple ideas simultaneously. This is an excellent way to get inspired and come up with new ideas. 2. One can be creative when they are working alone – this means that they have complete freedom and control over their work space. They can work on whatever they want, and no one else is interfering or checking them out. This can be a great way to come up with unique and innovative ideas. 3. One can be creative when they are working with others – this means that they are collaborating with other people throughout the entire process of creating something.

Patent applications: How do you apply for a patent?
When you come up with an invention, the easiest way to protect it is to apply for a patent. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In order to be considered for a patent, your invention must meet certain requirements, including: 
-Your invention must be new and not using copyrighted material
-Your invention must be on a subject that is currently being used in commerce or in the development of a product
-Your invention must have a clear and novel idea that can be patented
-Your Invention should be based on an existing product or service There are several ways to file for a patent, but many people start by submitting their idea to a competition or through their professional Labs. The USPTO has many resources available online so you can get started.

Invention ideas are everywhere
Invention ideas are everywhere. You just have to be open to them. Most people go through life without ever thinking about inventing something, but the truth is that anyone can do it. All it takes is a little bit of creativity and a willingness to think outside the box.
If you're looking for invention ideas, start by taking a look at the things around you that could be improved. What annoys you on a daily basis? What would make your life easier? Chances are, there are others out there who feel the same way and would love to use your invention.

Another great place to find invention ideas is by talking to people. Ask them about the problems they face on a daily basis. What do they wish they had that would make their lives easier? You may be surprised at how many people have great ideas for inventions but never act on them.
