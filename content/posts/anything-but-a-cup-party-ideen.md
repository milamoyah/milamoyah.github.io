How innovation benefits society:
Innovation benefits society by increasing productivity, innovation reducing costs, and improving the quality of products. Productivity is the amount of work done per hour. Reducing costs is the lowering of prices or the reduction in cost of producing a good or service. Improving quality is the improvement of something that does not meet all expectations, for example a product that is not as effective as it should be. Innovation can be thought of as any change in how something is done, from making a new product to changing how services are provided.
