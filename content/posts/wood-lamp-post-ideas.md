What is innovation and why do we need it?
Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.
There are a few different types of innovation: scientific, technological, economic, social and cultural. Scientific innovation occurs when scientists come up with new ways to study the world around them and improve our understanding of it. Technical innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make products or services more efficient or effective. Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services. Social innovation happens when people come up with ideas for different organizations or societies that could benefit from them.

Invention and Technology
Invention has always been a key component of technology. From fire starters to jetpacks, invention has helped people get the job done. But what happens when an invention is too good to be true? In some cases, this is where companies find themselves in a predicament. For example, the iPhone was initially thought to be a hoax because its creators couldn't find any evidence that it existed. However, over time Apple became known for its innovative design and features. Similarly, the Internet of Things (IoT) is another area where inventions have led to innovation. By making it easier for devices to communicate with each other, IoT has opened up new possibilities for businesses and individuals.
