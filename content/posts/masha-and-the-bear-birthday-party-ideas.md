What is invention?
Invention, sometimes called the discovery of a valuable new technology or process, is a moment when an idea or design comes to someone and they decide to put it into use. Invention can be something as simple as a new way of making a product, or something more complex like creating a new method for extracting oil from coal. It can come from anyone – even people who have nothing to lose. Inventors are often able to see their ideas through to the end, and often find new ways to make their products or processes even more effective. For example, inventors who create air-conditioning technology may not have thought about how it would be used in hot climates, but they came up with a better way to cool buildings and this has led to new applications for the technology all over the world.

Idea 2: Reflect on your favorite memories
What are your favorite memories? What makes them so special? What do they make you feel on a deep level? These are all good questions to ask yourself, and the answers will help you shape your ideas into something truly unique. Here are a few examples: 
1. One of my favorite memories is of when I was a little girl and my family went on an overnight camping trip. It was such an amazing experience to be with my parents and see the country in all its glory. It still makes me emotional to think about it now. 
2. Another great memory from childhood is going skating with my friends in our local park. skating on winter days was one of the best things ever! Even though it's been years since that experience, I can still feel the excitement and happiness that came along with it.
