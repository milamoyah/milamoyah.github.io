Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.

How can we develop big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, anyone can have them. It's just a matter of coming up with a plan and executing it. Here are four tips that can help you get started:
1. Definition: What is your idea?

 defines your idea in the most concise way possible, which will give you more room to work on it without feeling overwhelmed. Once you've nailed down what your idea is, make sure that everyone who will need to hear it (including yourself) agrees on its importance. This will ensure that the idea has enough power to carry out its potential.

2. Execution: How are you going to execute your idea?

This is where things get tricky. If your plan isn't well- thought-out or if you don't have enough manpower or resources at your disposal, your idea won't be able to take off.
