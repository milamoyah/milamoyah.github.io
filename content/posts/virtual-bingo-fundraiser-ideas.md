How to get started: What should you do before starting any creative project?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any creative project. Before starting any creative project, it's important to have a grasp of what you want to create. There are many different ways to get started, but some things you should keep in mind before starting any creative project: 1) Know your target audience. What do you want your project to achieve? Are you looking to generate new ideas for clients or sell products? Knowing the target audience is key in getting started. 2) Be prepared for failure. Have you ever tried something and it didn't work out? Don't be afraid to give up. You can always try again later if the first attempt doesn't work. 3) Have a plan. A plan is key in making sure that your creative project goes smoothly and that you don't run into any problems along the way. 4) Be willing to grow and learn.

The future of technology: How will it change our lives?
As technology advances, we are starting to see the beginnings of a future where it will change our lives in ways we cannot even imagine. Some of the key changes that could occur include: 
1. Improved security and privacy - With more information available online, people are more likely to be careless with their personal data. This could lead to a rise in cybercrime, as criminals can use this information to steal from individuals or organizations. 
2. New ways of communicating - Technology has given us new ways of communicating which could have serious implications for our society and economy. For example, we could see a rise in virtual reality, which allows people to experience different worlds without ever leaving their homes. This could have important implications for the future of work and education, as well as how we interact with others online.
