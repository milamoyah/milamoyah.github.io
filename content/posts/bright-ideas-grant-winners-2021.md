What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere, and it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas to get you started: 
-Start with what you know. What are some things that you enjoy doing or have a special interest in? Try thinking of ways to combine those hobbies with your creativity. 
-Explore new creative routes. Once you know some creative methods, start exploring different ways of doing things. What works for one artist might not work for another, but there is always room for growth. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is an idea to get started on something new. Experiment until you find something that works and then copy it!
