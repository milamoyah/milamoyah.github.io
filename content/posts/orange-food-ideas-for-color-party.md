Trends in social media: How will people communicate and share their ideas?
New trends in social media continue to emerge, and many people are exploring the various platforms to share their ideas. These days, it's not difficult to find a message or idea that can be shared on social media. However, there are some key considerations that should be made when creating content for social media. 
One of the most important things to remember when sharing content on social media is to keep it concise and to the point.

If you want your content to stand out from the rest, you need to create something new and unique.

The benefits of having Big Ideas.
There are a number of benefits to having big ideas, from increasing creativity and innovation to improving productivity and motivation. Here are four ways in which big ideas can help you achieve your goals: 
1. By definition, a big idea is something that is much larger than what has been done before. This can help you think outside the box, and allow you to come up with new and exciting ideas that may not have been possible before. 
2. Big ideas can also be more challenging than average, which can give you an opportunity to see how far you can push yourself and try new things. This could mean that if you’re looking for a project to work on that’s both challenging and innovative, a big idea might be the perfect fit for you.
