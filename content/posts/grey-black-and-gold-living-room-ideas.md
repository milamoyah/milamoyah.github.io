Aesthetic preferences: What kind of things make someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors?
Creative endeavors can be both rewarding and challenging, but they always include some form of art. Whether it's the creation of beautiful paintings or the designing of innovative new technologies, artists are always working to improve their skills. One important aspect of artistic excellence is aesthetics, which refers to the way a person looks. There are a variety of factors that can influence an artist's appearance, and many people have different preferences when it comes to what makes someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors. Some people prefer simple, unadorned designs while others enjoy colorful and intricate pieces. Some people like their artwork to be popular and flashy while others prefer more introspective pieces that will get them noticed. However, there is no one definitive way that artists look good or bad in their work. It ultimately depends on how they approach their art and how they feel about themselves as individuals.

Changes in the job market: 2019 predictions for the US economy
The job market continues to grow, with new jobs being created at a steady clip. But the future of the economy is still uncertain, as there are several possible trends that could affect the job market in the next few years. 
One trend that could have an impact on the job market is a rise in automation. This technology is slowly changing the way businesses operate, and as it does, many jobs will become obsolete or difficult to fill. As automation takes hold, many people may have to move into new positions, which could lead to increased unemployment rates. 

Another potential trend that could affect the job market in the next few years is a rise in wages. This increase may be due to factors such as better economic conditions and rising productivity levels. However, it can also happen as a result of negotiations between companies and unions over wages.
