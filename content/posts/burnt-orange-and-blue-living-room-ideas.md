What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can always count on. With the right mindset, any big idea can be turned into a successful business venture. So what are some of the most common big ideas? Here are five of the most common:
1. Start with something small. When you have a big goal in mind, it’s easier to focus on smaller steps that will make your dream a reality. This is especially true for businesses – by starting with something small, you can gradually increase your chances of achieving your larger goal.

2. Be persistent. If you want to achieve success, don’t give up until the end. Pounds saved every month will eventually lead to more money in your pocket and more customers coming through your door.

Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information. It has been used in various ways such as for gaming, speech recognition, and more. 
One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence is its ability to learn quickly and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This makes it ideal for tasks such asAutonomous Patrols or airport security. Another advantage is its ability to improve our understanding of the world around us. For example, if you were looking for a restaurant, AI could help you find one that was close by or give you recommendations based on your interests.
