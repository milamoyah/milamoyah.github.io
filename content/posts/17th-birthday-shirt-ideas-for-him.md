The role of innovation in the economy: What are the benefits for businesses and consumers?
Innovation is a critical part of the economy, and for companies and consumers it can have a number of benefits. For businesses, innovation can lead to new products or services that are better-suited to meet specific needs or requirements. For consumers, innovation can mean finding new ways to purchase or use products or services.
There are a number of benefits to innovation that businesses and consumers can take advantage of. The two main benefits are increased efficiency and reduced costs.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.

Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that can be broken down into three main parts: Ideation, Execution, and Delivery. Ideation is the process of coming up with ideas or solutions to problems. Execution is the task of putting these ideas into action and making them a reality.
