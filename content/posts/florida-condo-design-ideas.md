Types of creativity: Mental, physical, emotional, spiritual.
Creativity is an intangible quality that can be described in many ways. Mental creativity, for example, refers to the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions quickly and without thought. Physical creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to move your body and make physical changes in order to create new ideas or solutions. Emotional creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to feel positive emotions such as happiness, joy, joyfulness, and contentment. Spiritual creativity refers to the ability to connect with God or another higher power and come up with new ideas or solutions.
