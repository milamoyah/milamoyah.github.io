What is the definition of invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that never existed before. Invention can come from anything, from a simple idea to a novel technology. Some inventions are so important that they have led to entire industries, such as antibiotics and jet engines. Others are more mundane, like improved rice varieties or new ways to store gasoline.

Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.
