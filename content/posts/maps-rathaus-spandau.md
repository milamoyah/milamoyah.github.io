The role of creativity in art: What does it mean for the artist?
Creativity has been in the eye of the beholder since Antiquity. Whether it be in painting, architecture or music, creativity is what makes art. However, what does creativity actually mean for an artist? In classical times, creativity was considered to be a gift from God. Today, we understand that creativity is something that can be developed through practice and practice can take many different forms. For example, a musician may learn how to play an instrument and then use that knowledge to create new music. An artist may learn how to paint and then use their creative skills to create works of art. While there is no set definition for creativity, most agree that it includes the ability to see things differently than others and to come up with new ideas. In other words, creativity is a state of being where one's thoughts and feelings drive their actions.

How do we create communities that work for everyone, regardless of age or background?
In an age where technology has opened up so many opportunities for people to connect and share ideas, it's important that communities remain accessible and inclusive. Ideas 2022 is a project that aims to create communities that work for everyone, regardless of background or age. By creating platforms that allow users to share their thoughts, experiences and ideas anonymously, we can help our younger members feel more connected and welcome in these often-competitive spaces. With this in mind, we're proposing the following: 1) Make it easier for people to find each other by providing a search bar on every community page. This way, anyone with an internet connection can join any discussion or start a new one without having to worry about who they're talking to. 2) Include more than just pictures and links on community pages. Use images, videos and articles to help make your site more engaging for users.
