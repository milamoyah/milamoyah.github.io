Idea 2: Reflect on your favorite memories
What are your favorite memories? What makes them so special? What do they make you feel on a deep level? These are all good questions to ask yourself, and the answers will help you shape your ideas into something truly unique. Here are a few examples: 
1. One of my favorite memories is of when I was a little girl and my family went on an overnight camping trip. It was such an amazing experience to be with my parents and see the country in all its glory. It still makes me emotional to think about it now. 
2. Another great memory from childhood is going skating with my friends in our local park. skating on winter days was one of the best things ever! Even though it's been years since that experience, I can still feel the excitement and happiness that came along with it.

Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you don’t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.

The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.
