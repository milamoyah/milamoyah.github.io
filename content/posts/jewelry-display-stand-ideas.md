Definition: Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality.
Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction. Expressively creative art often uses creativity to escape from reality. An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience. An example of an abstract artist's work could be a painting without any specific objects or movements, allowing the viewer to imagine what it might look like.
