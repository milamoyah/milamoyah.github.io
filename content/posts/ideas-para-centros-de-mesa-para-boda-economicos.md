Benefits of invention: How does an idea create value for someone?
Inventions can create value for their creators in many ways, from making a profit to improving the quality of life. But what happens when an invention is created by someone who has no idea what it will do? In that case, the inventor may not see any benefits to their creation, and may even face ridicule and scorn from those who know about the invention. But even if the inventor doesn't have any idea what their invention will do, they still have a right to reap the benefits of their hard work. And there are plenty of those benefits - plenty of people are willing to pay money for products that are created using ideas and innovations.
