The different types of Innovation
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea, technology, or business model that is different from what has been done before. This can be done through creativity, hard work, and luck. Innovation can also come from within a company or organization itself. Sometimes, innovation happens during the development stage of a product or service, while other times it happens during the design or manufacturing process.
