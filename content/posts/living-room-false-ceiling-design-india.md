2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

The challenges of invention: Describe some of the challenges faced by inventors.
Invention is often lauded as the key to progress. Indeed, many of the most important advances in human history have come about through invention. But what is often overlooked is the fact that invention can be a difficult and challenging process. Inventors must not only be creative, but they must also have the persistence and determination to see their ideas through to fruition.
The challenges of invention are many and varied. Inventors must first come up with an idea that is both novel and useful. They then need to find a way to turn that idea into a reality, which often requires a great deal of trial and error. Even after an invention is completed, there are still challenges to be faced, such as marketing the invention and ensuring that it meets all safety and regulatory requirements.
