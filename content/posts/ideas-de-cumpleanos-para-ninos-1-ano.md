The Invention of the Telescope
In the early 1600s, a scientist named Nicholas-Jacques Conte designed and built the first telescope.

How to start a small business
Starting a small business can be a daunting task, but there are a few key steps that you can take to make it easier. Here are some tips to get started:
1. think about your target market. What is your main focus? Are you selling products or services? Do you have an existing customer base? If not, what do you need to do to reach them?

2. research your competition. Do you have any competitors in your industry that you could study and contrast yourself against? This will help provide direction for your business idea.

3. create a plan of attack. How will you market and sell your product or service? How will you generate revenue? What type of marketing strategy will work best for YOU and YOUR business? This information should be included in the business plan (or indeed, anywhere else related to starting a small business).

The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.

Thesis: There are a lot of new ideas out there, but what are the best ones?
The best new ideas come from a variety of sources, but some of the most promising concepts come from the fields of neuroscience and computer science. These two fields are providing researchers with innovative ways to study the human brain and provide insights into how we process information. In neuroscience, researchers are currently working on understanding how the brain functions and how it is changed by experience. This research could lead to new treatments for mental health problems and possible cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease. Meanwhile, in computer science, researchers are working on developing advanced virtual reality headsets and other gaming platforms that could revolutionize how people learn new skills. By understanding these two branches of research, scientists can develop better ideas for products and services that would be more effective or fun for users.
