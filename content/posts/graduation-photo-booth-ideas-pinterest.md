The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.
