The different approaches to creativity: art, design, science, and technology.
Creativity is a word that is often used interchangeably with art, design, science and technology. Each of these fields has its own approach to creativity, which can be seen in different ways. For example, art typically involves creating something new and original. Design is the process of coming up with a plan or specification for an object or project. Science is the study of the natural world and how it behaves. This can include studying how things work and how we can use that knowledge to create objects or projects. All of these approaches to creativity can have different benefits, which are important to consider when designing or creating objects or projects.

The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.
