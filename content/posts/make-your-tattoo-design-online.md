How to Come up with Creative Ideas
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but it can be hard to come up with them. There are a few things that help: having an idea, brainstorming, testing, and iteration. 
Here are some tips for coming up with creative ideas:

1. Brainstorm - Brainstorming is key to coming up with new ideas. Start by thinking about the problem you want to solve and how you can improve on what's already out there. What are the possible solutions? 
2. Test - Once you've generated some brainstorm fodder, it's time to test it out. Do something different or innovative with it and see if it works or not. This will help you get a better understanding of how your idea works and what problems might need to be solved in order for it to work well.

Pre-existing Conditions: What are some potential solutions to this problem?
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people looking for ways to help those who have pre-existing conditions. A variety of solutions have been proposed, with the most popular being increasing access to health insurance and creating new government programs that would help those with pre-existing conditions. However, each solution has its own set of disadvantages and drawbacks. One potential solution to this problem is increasing access to health insurance. This could be done through expanding Medicaid or creating new companies that offer affordable health insurance across all states. Additionally, increasing access to health insurance could also be done by reforming the Affordable Care Act so that it does not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act is a government program that helps people with pre-existing conditions get affordable health care.
