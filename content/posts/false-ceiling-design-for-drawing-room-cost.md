2. The size of the project: smaller tasks may require smaller tools, while bigger projects may require larger tools. Make sure to get a tool that is appropriate for your needs and your skill level.

3. The type of project: Some projects are better suited for one-time use, while others may require more expertise or experience than what is available at home.
