The role of creativity in art: What are some benefits to using creativity in artwork?
Creativity is an important factor in art. For example, when artists create pieces that are unique and share a certain style, they are able to stand out from other artists. Additionally, using creativity can help improve a piece of artwork. For example, if an artist is trying to come up with new ideas for a painting, they may be more creative when creating the design than if they were just following someone else’s idea. Lastly, creativity can also be used in order to make an artwork look more professional or attractive.
