The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.

The formation of ideas
When it comes to the formation of ideas, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be aware of your own biases and assumptions. We all have them, and they can distort the way we see the world and the ideas we come up with.
It’s also important to be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. When you’re stuck in your own bubble, it’s easy to get tunnel vision and miss out on good ideas. But if you’re willing to step outside of your comfort zone and listen to other people, you might just be surprised by what you come up with.

Finally, don’t be afraid to experiment. Trying new things is how we learn and grow, so don’t be afraid to take risks.
