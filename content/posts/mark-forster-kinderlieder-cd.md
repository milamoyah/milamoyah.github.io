There are so many ways to think about ideas, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. One way to approach brainstorming is to come up with a few specific ideas that you can work on. Once you’ve chosen a few, begin to think about what implications each one might have. Once you’ve come up with a few rough drafts, it’s time to test them out and see what works best for your story.

How does brainstroming work?
Brainstroming is a form of mental stimulation that allows people to focus and learn. It is commonly used in education, work, and other areas where explosions of information are needed. The process begins by sitting in a quiet room and focusing on one object for 30 seconds. Then, you must take a break for 3 minutes and come back to the object. This process is repeated 10 times. The goal of brainstroming is to create an mental explosion that will allow you to learn more quickly and effectively.
