The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

How can we bring these ideas to life?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They give a direction, a potential solution, and a reason to keep going. By coming up with big ideas, you can inspire your team and yourself to continue trying new things even when things feel threatening or difficult. Here are eight ways to bring big ideas to life:
1. Come up with an idea that’s outside the box: There’s no shame in being original, but many startups focus on what others are doing instead of coming up with their own concepts or solutions. If you don’t have anything similar in mind, you can always consider using popular trends or phrases as your starting point.

2. Take on a challenge: When it comes time to come up with a concept or solution, sometimes challenges are what help foster creativity and innovation.
