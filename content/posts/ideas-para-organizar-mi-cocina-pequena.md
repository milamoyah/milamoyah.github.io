There is no one definition of innovation, but it refers to any new idea, approach, or technology that creates value for an organization. Innovation can come from the smallest changes in a product or company strategy, to the most significant shift in the way people interact with their environment.

Innovation is what makes businesses thrive, and it’s what keeps them competitive.
