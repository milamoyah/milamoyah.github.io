Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.

Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.

Creative Approaches: What are some methods for coming up with ideas?
Creative Approaches to Ideas: 1. Brainstorming: Start by brainstorming all the possible ways that your idea could be developed. What are some ideas for stories, designs, products, or services? What are some ideas for marketing campaigns? What are some ideas for developing a business strategy? 2. Introspection: Take time to explore what you like and don't like about your idea. Are there any elements that you would like more attention to or that feel too limiting? Are there any areas where you can make your idea better? 3. Hypothesis: Now that you've explored what you like and don't like about your idea, it's time to come up with an introspective hypothesis about why people might want to use your product or service. What is the potential market for your product or service? How do you think people will use it?
