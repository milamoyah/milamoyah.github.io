The power of creativity
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It is the ability to see things differently, to make connections that others don’t see, and to come up with new ideas and solutions.
Creativity is what allows us to solve problems, to invent new technologies, and to create works of art that move and inspire us. It is the engine of progress. And it is something that we all have within us.

So why is creativity so powerful? One reason is that it helps us to see the world in new ways. When we are faced with a problem, creative thinking allows us to find new solutions that we might not have otherwise considered.

Another reason is that creativity allows us to tap into our imagination and come up with ideas that are truly original.

Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
