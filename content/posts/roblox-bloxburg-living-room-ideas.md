What are some ideas?
There are many ideas when it comes to improving your health and well-being. Here are a few to get you started: 
1. Try a new diet or exercise routine. This can help improve your overall health by reducing your risk of disease, improving your energy levels, and reducing the likelihood of developing chronic conditions like obesity or heart disease. 
2. Get more sleep. Make sure you get at least 7 hours of sleep per night, preferably 8 hours or more. This will help improve your mental wellbeing, reduce stress levels, and promote better cognitive function. 
3. Get enough exercise. Losing weight is important for overall health, but being active also helps to prevent chronic diseases like obesity and heart disease from becoming established.

Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.
