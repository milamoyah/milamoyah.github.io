Some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique:
When it comes to problem solving, one of the most important techniques is brainstroming. Brainstroming is a process of using your thoughts and ideas to brainstorm solutions to problems. It’s a great way to come up with potential solutions and get started on solving a problem. However, there are some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique. Here are five examples:
1) You don’t have enough time: Brainstroming is supposed to be a process that takes around 20 minutes. If you’re trying to solve a problem that’s taking longer than that, you may not have enough time left to come up with solutions.

2) You don’t know what you’re looking for: WhenBrainstroming, you need to be specific about what you want to come up with.

The Different Types of Ideas: What are they?
Ideas are things that get your mind going and can help you solve problems. There are many different types of ideas, but these are the three most common:
1. The brainstorming idea: This is the idea that you come up with without anything specific in mind. It's just a thought or an idea that pops into your head.

2. The creative idea: This is an external perspective on something that you've already been thinking about or working on. It can help you come up with a new solution or approach to a problem.

3. The problem-solving idea: This is the mental construct that helps you see how everything works together to create a single goal or solution.

How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
