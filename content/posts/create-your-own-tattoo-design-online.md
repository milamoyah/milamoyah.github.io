The Future of Innovation: What challenges will we face as we continue to explore new ways to approach life and work?
One of the challenges facing humanity as we continue to explore new ways to approach life and work is that there is no one definitive answer to how innovation should be approached. Some argue for a more open-minded approach, in which innovation is seen as a tool that can be used for good, while others suggest that any new technology or approach should be tested and refined before it is put into widespread use. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure: There will always be people who argue for change, even when it comes to how we approach innovation.

Creative process: how does creativity happen?
Creativity happens in a many ways, but one of the most common is through the creative process. This process starts with idea generation, which can be both mental and physical. Once an idea has been generated, it needs to be defended and considered. Once it's considered, it needs to be put into practice in order to see if it's a good idea or not. There are different steps that need to be followed in order for an idea to become a reality, but the most important part is that the creative team is together and working towards a common goal.

How creativity manifests in different people: Inventors are the most creative, while artists are more creative when they have a personal connection to their work
Creativity is not only evident in inventors, but also in artists. When artists have a personal connection to their creativity, they are more likely to express it. This has been shown by many studies that show creativity flourishes when people have close relationships with others. For example, according as the work of Dr. Philippa Parris and Dr. Christopher Lasch shows, creative people are more willing to communicate their ideas and feelings than those who do not have such a relationship. 
However, the connection between artist and inventor does not always exist. In some cases, the two groups of people may be completely different in terms of creativity. Also, it is important to note that creativity does not come from having one’s ideas constantly tested or experimented with; it generally comes from being open-minded andCEPTIVE towards new ideas.

Definition of big ideas: What is it that you want your company to achieve?
When it comes to big ideas, there is no one right answer. Some companies achieve their goals by focusing on a few key areas while others have a more holistic approach. What matters most is that your company has initiatives that are meaningful and impactful. Definitions of big ideas can vary, but all should include at least one important factor: The potential for success. 
If you’re not sure what it means to have a big idea, ask yourself this question: How will your company benefit from developing this initiative? Once you know the answer, you can start brainstorming ways your business can use the product or service to achieve its goals.
