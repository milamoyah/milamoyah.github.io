Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

What are the benefits of big ideas?
There are many benefits to big ideas, including increased creativity, innovation, and productivity. However, there are also a few key considerations that should be taken into account when creating big ideas. Here are four tips to help you create better big ideas:
1. Be clear and concise: The more information you can provide in a clear and concise manner, the easier it will be for others to understand your concept and develop a plan for implementing it.

2. Be realistic: Always be honest with your expectations and goals when developing big ideas. Don’t try to “solve everything” – instead focus on areas that can be quickly improved or neglected.

3. Get input from others: When developing your big idea, always consult with others in order to get their feedback and thoughts on the idea before moving forward.
