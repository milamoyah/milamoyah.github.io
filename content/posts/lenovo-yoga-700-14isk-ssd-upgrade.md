Goals: What are our goals for 2022?
The 2022 FIFA World Cup is coming up and there are a few things that everyone is focusing on. One of the things that seems to be getting a lot of attention is the goalkeepers’ competition. Many people are wondering what our goals for the tournament are, and whether or not they will be met. Here are some ideas for what our goals may be: 
1) We want to win the trophy. This has been a main goal of ours for quite some time now, and we believe that we can do it if we focus hard and take our game to new levels. 

2) We want to make sure that our players are given everything they need to be successful. We understand that some players may have had their best years already past them, so we want to help them recapture those formative years and continue making progress forward.
