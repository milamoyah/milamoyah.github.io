The best ways to be creative
There is no one answer for how to be creative. However, some ways to become more creative include: practicing brainstorming, keeping a journal, and taking on new challenges.
One way to become more creative is to practice brainstorming. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate new ideas. To brainstorm, you can start by asking yourself questions about a topic or problem you are trying to solve. Once you have generated some ideas, you can then evaluate them and choose the best solution.

Another way to become more creative is to keep a journal. A journal can help you track your thoughts and ideas over time. You can also use it to explore new topics and problems. By writing down your thoughts, you can better understand your own thought process and come up with new ideas more easily.

The Best Ideas: What are the best ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to get things started and can help you solve problems. Here are some of the best ideas on how to start working on your projects: 
1. Start with a blank slate: This is definitely one of the most popular ideas and can be used for both creative and everyday tasks. Create a list of ideas and then use them as a starting point for your next project. 
2. Take risks: When it comes to creativity, there’s no guarantee that everything will work out, but doing something new and risky can be a great way to get started. If something doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up–you can always try again later. 
3. Collaborate: Collaborating with other people is another great way to get started on your projects.

Scientific brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. It usually happens when an individual is working on a project and they have no other ideas.
