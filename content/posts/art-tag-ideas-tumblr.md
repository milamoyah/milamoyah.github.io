Home decorating ideas: From simple to intricate
Start with the basics: A home is a place of refuge, and comfort. You should make it your own by filling it with comfortable and stylish pieces that will help you relax and feel at home. Here are some simple but effective home decorating ideas to get you started:
1. Add a design element with an old piece of furniture. Search online or in stores for pieces that are already in good condition and were once used as part of a décor scheme. This can be either a chair or a dresser, as long as it is still in good condition and has not been updated in years. Place the piece near the entrance of your home so that people coming home see it first before getting too lost in all the other pieces on your walls.

2. Keep things fresh by using new products and trends from time to time.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
