Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

2. Use positive reinforcement when you see results from your cleanliness efforts. For example, if you see that your kitchen is dirty but you're still making progress, give yourself a pat on the back! This will keep your motivation high and make sure that you continue to make good progress.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.

Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you donâ€™t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what youâ€™re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, itâ€™s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they arenâ€™t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.
