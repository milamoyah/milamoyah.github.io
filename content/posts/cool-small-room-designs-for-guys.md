The term "brainstroming" has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until 2006 that the term was coined to describe the phenomenon of individuals being overwhelmed by a single task or idea. The name comes from a phrase used by Eisenhower in his Farewell Address in 1961, where he spoke about the "massive national effort" which was needed to meet the challenges of the future. Brainstroming can be defined in many ways, but its most common definition would say that individuals are struggling to focus on one thing and unable to complete any other tasks.
