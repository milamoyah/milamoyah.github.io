Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been produced before. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one way to think about it is as a shift in how we look at things. Innovation can mean different options or approaches to problem solving, and it can also include the invention of new methods or technologies.
