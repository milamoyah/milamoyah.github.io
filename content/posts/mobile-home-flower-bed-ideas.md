Brainstroming is a process that helps people focus and think clearly. It's a type of concentration exercise that uses the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe is responsible for thinking, planning, and making decisions. It's also responsible for regulating emotions and controlling behavior. Brainstroming is effective when used in combinations with other aspects of concentration, such as practice, relaxation, and meditation.

Creative expression and the artist

There are many reasons why creativity and art exist, but one of the most important reasons is because it allows people to express themselves in a unique way. Art is often seen as a way to connect with the world, but it can also be used to build relationships with others. It allows people to share their ideas and feelings, and it can help them to connect with their surroundings.

The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.
