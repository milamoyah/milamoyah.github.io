Types of creativity:
Creativity is a broad term that can refer to any activity or feeling that leads to unique and original ideas. There are many different types of creativity, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: visual creativity, auditory creativity, and kinesthetic creativity.
Visual creativity is often measured by how much creative ideas the individual can come up with in a short amount of time. This type of creativity is often associated with art, fashion, and design. Visual artists may use various mediums such as paintings, sculptures, graphics, photography, and 3D printing to create their output.

The Future of Education: What will be the future of education?
The future of education is a question that has been asked for centuries and will continue to be asked in the coming years. Many different ideas have been proposed as to what the future of education should be, but no one single answer has emerged as the definitive answer. Some possible answers include: 
"Equality of opportunity" 
"Universal Basic Education" 
"Teacher training programs for all skill levels" 
" computer-assisted learning "
In terms of ideas, the most likely answer would be a form of universal basic education. This would provide all citizens with equal access to education, regardless of their economic status or educational qualifications. Another idea that has been proposed is teacher training programs for all skill levels. This would allow people of all skill levels to learn how to teach, which would then help reduce teaching costs and improve overall school quality.
