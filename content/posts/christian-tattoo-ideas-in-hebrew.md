What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.

Considerations when renovating or upgrading: What should you take into account when renovating or upgrading your home?
Renovating or upgrading your home can be a great way to update and improve the look and feel of your home. However, there are some important considerations you should take into account when renovating or upgrading your home. Here are a few key points to keep in mind: 
1. Use common sense when renovating or upgrading your home – don’t overdo things and wait until it’s too late. You may not be able to afford to make any necessary changes later on, and you may not have the time or resources to do so. If you wait, you could end up regretting your decision. 
2. Don’t overspend – it’s always better to initially save up money rather than spend more on unnecessary features that won’t actually improve the look or function of your home.
