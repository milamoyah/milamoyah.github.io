What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern’s newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you’ve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.
