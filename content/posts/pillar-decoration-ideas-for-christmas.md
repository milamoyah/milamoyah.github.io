How can you use brainstroming to your advantage?
The power of brainstroming is clear. By using the right tools, you can use your brain to make decisions that will benefit you and your business. Brainstroming can help you focus on what’s important, gain insights into complex problems, and create better strategies. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Get a clear understanding of what you want from a problem or opportunity. This will help you identify the most important aspects of the problem or opportunity. 

2. Use brainstorms as a tool for brainstorming solutions and for exploring potential solutions to problems. 

3. Choose wisely which ideas to share with others in a brainstorming session – some ideas may be more important than others. Brainstorming is an open-ended process, so it’s best not to limit yourself too much.
