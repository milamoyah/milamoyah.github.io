The power of creativity: How does it work?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ways of doing things. It can be found in everything from making art to building a business. In many cases, creativity comes from a creative process that starts with thinking out of the box.
One way creativity works is by sparking new ideas. When people are creative, they often have more ideas than they can actually use because they are brainstorming. This allows them to explore different possibilities and come up with new concepts.

Another way creativity works is by providing stimulation. The more ideas someone has, the more likely they are to come up with one that works. This can be found in anything from working on a project to playing games. creatvity also stems from the environment in which someone lives or works. If something provides an opportunity for creativity, people tend to take advantage of it.
