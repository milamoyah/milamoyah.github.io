How does innovation help businesses succeed?
Businesses that are able to innovate and embrace change are able to grow their businesses faster and achieve success. Innovation can be done in a number of ways, but some of the most common methods include:

3. Updating old methods – again, this could come from outside of the company or inside themselves if they’re using outdated processes or tools.
