Safety basics for do-it-yourselfers: Every project has its own safety guidelines, so be sure to follow them carefully when planning and carrying out a DIY
If you're a do-it-yourselfer, be sure to follow safety basics when planning and carrying out projects. Here are a few tips:
1. Follow local safety guidelines: Many projects require special attention when done by yourself, such as building your own basement or installing a new roof. Cities with stricter safety regulations often have more specific safety guidelines that you must obey. Follow these rules to avoid potential injuries or worse.

2. Use common sense: When planning any project, always use common sense and take precautions before beginning. For example, don't try to fix something without first knowing how it works - this can lead to dangerous surprises down the road!

3. Get help if needed: If you need assistance with a project, don't hesitate to ask friends or family members for help. They may have experience and knowledge that you didn't consider.

2. Do your research before starting something. Once you have an idea for something, it's important to do some research so that you're not wasting time and money on something that doesn't have a lot of potential. 
3. Be patient.
