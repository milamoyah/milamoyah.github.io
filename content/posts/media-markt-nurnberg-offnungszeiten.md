Ideas are what drive forward our projects and make us feel motivated. They allow us to see potential solutions and solutions that might be better, and to come up with new ways of doing things. Ideas can come from anywhere, and they can include anything from a thought that has never occurred to you before, to something you just thought of. What's important is that ideas are not just ideas, but something you can work on and keep putting into practice.

Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).
