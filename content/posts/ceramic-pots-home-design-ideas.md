Origins of Invention: The development of physical and mental abilities
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem. The first invention may have been something as simple as a new way to chop wood, but over time, the innovation and creativity of people have led to some amazing gadgets and technologies. One such example is the wheel, which was first invented by an ancient Egyptian man named Thoth. This invention led to the development of agriculture and subsequent growth in civilization.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
