Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

Creative Ideas For You: What do you have in mind that you haven't thought of before?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with creative ideas. First, think about what you want your idea to accomplish. Sometimes all it takes is a little creativity and inspiration to come up with something new and exciting. Second, make sure that your idea is feasible. If your idea doesn't have a lot of money or time put into it, it might not be worth your while to pursue it. Finally, make sure that your idea is funny or entertaining enough before you even think about pursuing it. These three points will help make any creative ideas more likely to become reality.
