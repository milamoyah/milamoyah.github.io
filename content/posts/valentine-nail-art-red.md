What to do with ideas: From brainstorming to taking them to market
Ideas are like stars in a sky. They can bring light to a dark room or help you turn a negative into a positive. However, like most things in life, they come with baggage. Sometimes the baggage is good, and other times it’s bad. Here are four tips for dealing with ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas 
No one ever has all the answers to every question or problem. “Open your mind” and let new ideas flow in. Even if they don’t work out, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them. 
2. Take the time to study what worked before 
Studying what others have done can help you develop your own idea without feeling bound by former solutions or failures.
