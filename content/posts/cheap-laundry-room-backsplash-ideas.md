What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the activity of brainstorming. Brainstorming is an effective way to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. When done correctly, brainstroming can lead to improved business plans, strategies and operations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when trying to achieve brainstroming success.

1) Brainstorming should be formed into teams or groups in order to provide more cohesion. This will help prevent members from working on individual projects at the same time.
2) Brainstorming should be focused on solving real-world problems rather than just coming up with new ideas. This will help your team become more knowledgeable about the problem at hand and can help you develop better solutions.
