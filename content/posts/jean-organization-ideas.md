The Top 5 Diy Ideas for House Cleaning
1. Make a simple cleaning routine: daily sweeping, dusting, mopping, and vacuuming will help keep your home clean and free of dirt and dust mites.
2. Use an all-natural cleaner: certain ingredients can help remove dirt and other stains from surfaces without harsh chemicals.
3. Add a touch of Grace: think about ways to add personality to your home with furniture or decor that is fresh and new.
4. Keep your windows clear: use a screen protector or window cleaner to keep the view looking great while keeping particles out of the glass panes.
5. Add some whimsy: consider adding wacky little accessories to your home like jester hats or incenses to give it a whimsical feel.

However, there are also some lessons we can learn from history about Invention. For example, it is important to remember that Invention is a gradual process.

In other cases, the inventor may have been inspired by someone else's work or by a movie or book.

4th idea:
There are a lot of ideas out there. How do you know which ones are worth pursuing? And how do you come up with new ideas in the first place?
Here are four ways to come up with better ideas:

1. Be open to new experiences

If you want to have more and better ideas, you need to be open to new experiences. That means trying new things, meeting new people, and exposing yourself to new ideas. The more experiences you have, the more material you have to work with when it comes time to generate new ideas.

2. Be persistent

Coming up with good ideas is hard work. Don't expect to have a great idea every time you sit down to brainstorm. It takes time, effort, and a lot of trial and error. The key is to keep at it until you find that one winning idea.
