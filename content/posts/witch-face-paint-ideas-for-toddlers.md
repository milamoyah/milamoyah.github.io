The Basics: How do you choose the right tools and materials for a DIY project?
When starting a DIY project, the first step is to decide what you want to do. This can be broken down into five categories: tools, materials, method, tools and techniques, and time. Now that you have an idea of what you need and want, it's time to choose the right tools and materials for your project.
