Invention 3: A way to store energy
Invention 3: A way to store energy. 

Energy storage has been an issue for a long time. The traditional storage methods such as fossil fuels or nuclear power are not sustainable in the long term. 
But, using renewable energy sources can solve this problem. 
There are many ways to use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and waterpower to create electricity. However, the best option is solar. This is because it is easy to produce and reliable in the short run. 
Solar panels can be placed on roofs or in buildings, which makes them very affordable and easy to use. Moreover, they are very efficient in converting sunlight into electrical energy. 
 Wind turbines can also be used to generate electricity from the wind. However, these have high installed costs and need good location for installation.
