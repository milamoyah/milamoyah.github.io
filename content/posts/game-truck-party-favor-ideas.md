Introduce the topic of invention ideas

Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market.

They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

How can you come up with big ideas?
Big ideas are important when it comes to coming up with new ideas, but they can also be a challenge. There are a few things you can do to help come up with big ideas that will be successful. The first thing is to think about what you want your idea to achieve. Once you know what your idea is, you can start thinking about how you can make it a reality. Next, take into account the competition. If there are others who have similar ideas, it will be more difficult for them to come up with a better solution than yours. Finally, make sure your idea is feasible. This means that it should not be too much trouble for people to implement your idea, and it should not require too much money or time.
