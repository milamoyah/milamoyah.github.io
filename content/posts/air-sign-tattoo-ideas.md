The history of creativity: How has creativity evolved over time?
Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?
