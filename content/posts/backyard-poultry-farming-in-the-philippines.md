what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas or solutions. It is often used in a group setting, but can also be done alone. Brainstorming involves generating a list of ideas and then evaluating them to see which are the best.
There are a few different techniques that can be used when brainstorming. One is called free association, which is when you come up with ideas without censoring yourself. This can help you to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Another technique is called mind mapping, which is when you create a visual representation of your thoughts. This can help you to see the connections between different ideas and to better organize your thoughts.

Brainstorming can be a helpful way to generate new ideas or solutions to problems.
