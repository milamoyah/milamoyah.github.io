The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers. 
3. Brainstorm a title for your project. This will give you an idea of what your project will be called and help organize all the different parts of your project together. 
4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why itâ€™s important for them to invest in your project.

In 2022, many believe that the United States should consider a new immigration policy that prioritized people who can contribute to society. Ideas for this policy could include increasing the number of refugees who are allowed into the country, increasing the number of visas available for skilled immigrants, and lowering the waiting times for citizenship. Another idea is to have a more open exchange market between the US and other countries, which would create jobs and increase wages.
