Innovation can come from the smallest changes in a product or company strategy, to the most significant shift in the way people interact with their environment. It can also come from outside sources, such as startups and tech companies who are trying to change how the world works. Innovation is what makes businesses thrive, and it’s what keeps them competitive.
