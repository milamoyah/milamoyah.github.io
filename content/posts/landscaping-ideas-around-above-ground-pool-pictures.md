The Creative Process: How does creativity happen?
Creativity is an unpredictable process that often occurs during the creative process. It can be considered a type of improvisation, which is where ideas and thoughts come together without pre-determined plans or expectations. The creative process can be broken down into three main steps: ideation, creation, and Implementation. Ideation is when something new and unheard of comes to mind, while creation is when it is put into a realistic form through creativity and collaboration. Implementation is when the ideas are put into practice and turned into a reality.

What are some new ideas?
Some new ideas for healthy eating come in all shapes and sizes. Some people might just want to start incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their diets, while others might prefer whole grains or proteins. Whatever your preference, here are five healthy ideas to get you started: 
1) Try a plant-based protein shake instead of meat or chicken protein. Plant-based proteins are high in fiber and nutrients, which can help you feel fuller longer. 
2) Eat more vegetables and fruit as part of your breakfast and lunch. Vegetables contain seeds, which is a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When you eat them early in the morning or before lunch, you’re less likely to feel hungry later in the day. 
3) Make sure to add watercress to your diet whenever possible.
