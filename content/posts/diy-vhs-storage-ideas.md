Creative expression is the ability to express oneself through art. It can be considered either original or creative.

Creative expressions, on the other hand, are often inspired by another person or work and can be considered more collaborative. There are several key differences between creative expression and creativity, which can help to explain why one may be more advantageous than the other when it comes to creating art.

The Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed a signaling system that could be used to send messages over the air. This system, called the telegraph, allowed for communication between distant locations without having to rely on intermediaries. The telephone was created in 1877, when inventor John Ambrose Fleming developed a technology that allowed voice calls over the telephone line. The telephone was an incredibly important invention, not just because it allowed people to communicate with each other more efficiently, but also because it made communication possible from far away.

Causes of creative destruction: The creative process and its various variables
Creative destruction refers to the ability of new technologies, ideas, and processes to change the way businesses operate and create new opportunities. In today's economy, creative destruction is more than just a trend; it's a reality.
While there are many reasons behind creative destruction, one important factor is the ever-changing landscape of technology. As new devices and platforms arrive, old ways of doing business are no longer enough to keep up with the new competition. Businesses must adapt or perish.

One example of this is music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These services offer a unique way for listeners to access all types of music, from popular hits to obscure albums. While Spotify has been around for years and Apple Music was only released last year, both services have already made a name for themselves in the market.

This innovation is not limited to music either.
