Invention Displays: How can you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of protecting your invention from others who may want to make use of it. There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common is through filing a patent application. Patent applications can take many months to complete, so it’s important to be prepared for the wait. There are also several requirements that must be met in order to file a patent application, including having an idea for an invention and being able to prove that your idea is original. If you have any trouble filing a patent application or if it takes longer than expected, don’t worry – there are plenty of resources available to help you out.

Invention 4: a new way to produce energy from renewable resources
Invention ideas can produce energy from renewable resources in a variety of ways, some more efficient than others. One such idea is to create turbines that turn renewable energy into electricity. This could be useful for homes and businesses that do not have access to traditional power sources, or for those who are trying to save money on their energy bill. Another innovation is the use of solar panels to generate energy. These panels can be placed on roofs or in other locations where sunlight shines down on them, and they can also be used to generate power when the sun is not shining.
