Innovation in business: What are some examples of how innovation can be used in business?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or innovation that can solve a problem. Innovation can be used in business in many ways, from improving the efficiency of a business to creating new products or services. Here are some examples: 
1. Inexpensive home-theater systems could be replaced by more expensive models that use 3D projection technology to create an immersive experience. 
2. A company that produces respiratory masks could find new ways to market their products, such as using social media to reach more people in need and airing adverts on television stations across the United States. 
3. The production of chocolate could be improved by using insects as fermentation tanks instead of milk cows to make chocolate more nutritious and less costly.
