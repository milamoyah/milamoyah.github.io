Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

How to choose the right tools for your job: A guide to the right tools for the job
Tools are an essential part of any job, but choosing the right ones can be difficult. Here are three tips to help make the process easier:
1. Do your research: in order to make the best choices, it’s important to do your research and familiarize yourself with the different tools available. This will help you determine which ones would be best for your specific needs.

2. Choose wisely: don’t overspend on tools if you don’t need them. Make sure you know what type of tool is best suited for each job, and when these won’t suffice, consider investing in a more affordable option.

3. Get creative: there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to tool choice, so experiment until you find what works best for you and your work environment.
