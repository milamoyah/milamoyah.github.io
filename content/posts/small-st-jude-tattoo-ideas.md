The future of technology: How will it change our lives?
As technology advances, we are starting to see the beginnings of a future where it will change our lives in ways we cannot even imagine. Some of the key changes that could occur include: 
1. Improved security and privacy - With more information available online, people are more likely to be careless with their personal data. This could lead to a rise in cybercrime, as criminals can use this information to steal from individuals or organizations. 
2. New ways of communicating - Technology has given us new ways of communicating which could have serious implications for our society and economy. For example, we could see a rise in virtual reality, which allows people to experience different worlds without ever leaving their homes. This could have important implications for the future of work and education, as well as how we interact with others online.

Innovation in science and technology: How do we get there?
Innovation is a process of making something new and better. It can come from technology, science, or anything else that can be improved. There are many ways to make things better, and innovation depends on the right approach.
There are two primary ways to improve innovation: through early detection and correction of problems, and by developing new approaches to old problems. Early detection and correction is essential for ensuring that innovative ideas aren't just abandoned, but brought to market quickly so people can use them effectively.

Developing new approaches to old problems is another important way to improve innovation. This allows for more efficient use of resources, which in turn helps spur growth in businesses and create new jobs. It's important to find the right way to tackle old problems so they can be solved efficiently.

2020: The United States and China’s new relationship
As the world's two biggest economies start to elbow each other in 2020, it is important to ask what their new relationship will be. What are the key topics of discussion? What challenges does 2020 bring for the two countries? And is there anything in common between them that could help make their relationship stronger?
One area where China and the United States do have some similarities is their commitment to innovation. Beijing has long championed creativity as a way to improve society, and US President Donald Trump has also made innovation one of his priorities. In 2020, this focus will be put into full force as both countries fight against climate change – an issue that China has been advocating for years.
