The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

4) Improved patient engagement and adherence to treatments

One way is to make it easier for patients to find information about their treatments. Another way is to provide more comfortable and inviting chairs for patients to sit in. And lastly, hospitals could consider providing more information on the side of the hospital patient room so that patients can better understand what they are taking and how it might impact their health.
