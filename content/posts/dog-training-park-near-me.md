Some tips for using creativity in your work
Creativity is a powerful tool that can be used in your work to improve your productivity and effectiveness. Here are some tips to help you use creativity in your work: 1. Start with problems. When you start thinking about ways to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of your work, ask yourself how you could do things better. This will give you ideas for solving problems and making changes that will improve your work. 2. Be open to new ideas. New ideas are always welcome in any workplace, but be sure to give them a good chance before dismissing them as too strange or impossible. 3. Be willing to experiment. Experimenting with different methods and tasks can help you find the most effective way to succeed at your work. 4. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.
