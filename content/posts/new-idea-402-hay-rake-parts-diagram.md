Forces that may cause problems: What factors could lead to conflict in the future?
In the year 2022, a new force has surfaced that is likely to cause problems for countries and organizations in the future. This new force is called artificial intelligence (AI). AI has been shown to be incredibly powerful and can rapidly learn, which could lead to it becoming a greater threat than ever before. While there are ways to mitigate against the risk of AI becoming a major threat, there is also a high chance that it will do so.

Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is key to success in any field, yet it can be difficult to come by. There are a number of barriers that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of creativity.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. This can include both financial resources and human resources. If you don't have the money to invest in new ideas or the people to execute them, it can be very difficult to bring about change.

Another barrier to innovation is a lack of knowledge. If you're not aware of what's possible or you don't understand how things work, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. This is why education and research are so important for promoting innovation.

Finally, a barrier to innovation can simply be a lack of creativity.
