The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.
