What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from your ideas for a song to a way to improve the efficiency of your office. Sometimes the simplest things can make a big impact, and that's what makes creativity so powerful. So if you're looking for ways to turn your creative juices into new ideas, here are some great starting points: 
1. Try out different ways of presenting information. Not everyone is used to reading with an eye-level view, so try different methods and see which ones work best for you.

2. Invent something new or come up with an idea that's never been done before. There's nothing like taking on a challenge and seeing how well you can do it!

3. Take on a task that's currently too daunting or impossible for someone else.

In his article "Brainstroming: How Our Nerves Play a Vital Role in Thought and Action," (published in the journal "The Journal of Neuroscience"), Dr. Konrad Lorenz, a professor at the University of Vienna, suggested that our brains are actually two organs working in unison. He argued that the two systems work together to form a brainstrom, or group of integrated circuits. This group is what allows us to think and act effectively.
