How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.

Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists donâ€™t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.
