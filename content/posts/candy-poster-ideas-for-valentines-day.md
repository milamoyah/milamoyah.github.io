Innovation: How can you make your inventions more successful?
Inventions can be a great way to make your business more successful. By coming up with new ways to do things, you can make your products or services more affordable and accessible, or even create new markets for them. Here are four tips for making your inventions more successful:

Overcoming barriers to innovation
Innovation is essential for businesses to maintain a competitive edge, but it can be difficult to encourage employees to think outside the box. Overcoming these barriers is key to promoting a culture of innovation in your organization.
One barrier to innovation is risk aversion. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas for fear of being seen as failures if they don't work out. Encouraging a culture of experimentation can help overcome this hurdle by making it okay to try new things and fail.

Another common barrier is lack of resources. Employees may feel like they don't have the time or money to experiment with new ideas. Providing dedicated resources for innovation can help overcome this obstacle and show employees that you're serious about encouraging creativity.

Finally, some employees may simply be resistant to change. They may be comfortable with the way things are and see no need to innovate.

Invention can come from anyone, but it’s often most fruitful when it occurs in collaboration between two people. When something novel and new is created by two people, the potential for innovation is limitless.
