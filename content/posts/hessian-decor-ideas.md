The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.

Patent Applications: How do you file for an invention?
Patent applications are a common way to get your ideas out into the public domain. They can also be a way to protect your intellectual property and increase your chances of getting paid for your innovations. Here are some tips on how to file for an invention: 
- Make sure you have the proper paperwork in order to filing an application. This includes a patent application, published works, and any other supporting information. 
- Be prepared to answer many questions from researchers and patent applicants. It can be helpful to have an idea of what you're trying to create before you start filing. 
- File as soon as possible after the idea comes up in conversation or when you notice something that makes it interesting. You may not get the same response if you wait too long.

Invention life cycle: From idea to market debut
Invention life cycle is a process that starts with the idea and ends with the product in people's hands. The process begins with brainstorming, which is where ideas are shared and discussed. Next, there’s developing the idea, which can involve researching and coming up with proofs of concept. Once the idea is developed, it needs to be tested and validated to see if it can be turned into a reality. Lastly, there’s marketing and distribution to let people know about the product.

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.
