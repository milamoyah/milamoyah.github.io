Creativity in the workplace
A recent study has shown that creativity in the workplace is on the decline. This is due to a number of factors, including the increased pressure to succeed and the lack of time to truly be creative. However, there are a few ways to encourage creativity in the workplace.
One way to encourage creativity in the workplace is to set aside time for brainstorming sessions. During these sessions, employees should feel free to share any ideas they have, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. The goal is to get employees thinking outside of the box and coming up with new and innovative ideas.

Another way to encourage creativity in the workplace is to offer incentives for coming up with new and creative ideas. This could be anything from a cash bonus to extra vacation days. Whatever the incentive may be, it should be something that employees are motivated to achieve.

Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on what’s important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.
