Creative ideas: What to consider when creating them?
Creative ideas are a necessary part of any business or creative project. They can be used to improve your product, service, or idea. Here are some tips to consider when creating creative ideas:
1. What is your target market? When you’re thinking about creative ideas, it’s important to know what your target market is. Do you want to create an idea for a specific audience (like millennials), or do you want to create something that can be used by anyone?
