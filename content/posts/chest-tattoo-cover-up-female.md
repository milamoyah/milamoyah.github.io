Brainstroming is a technique used by mentalists to help them discover the hidden thoughts and confessions of the people they are questioning. Brainstroming can be done by using questionnaires, interviews, or even conversation with the person in question. The goal of brainstroming is to gain a better understanding of their thoughts and feelings, which can then be used to help secure their confessions.
