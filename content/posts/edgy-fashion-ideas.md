What Causes Innovation?
Innovation can be explained in a few ways. One way is to say that innovation comes from change. Another way to think about it is that innovation happens when something new and different comes along and helps someone or something do what they were supposed to do but didn't actually do it. 
One of the biggest reasons for innovation is often because someone needs a new product or service to solve a problem that they didn't previously have. Innovation also happens when people come up with new ways of doing things, or coming up with new ways to make things better.
