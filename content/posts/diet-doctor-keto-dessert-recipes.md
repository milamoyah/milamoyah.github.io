Definition: Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality.
Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction.

An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience.
