2. Define your target market: Once you have a mission, it’s time to define who your target market is. Who do you want to sell your products or services to? Do you want to attract people who already own certain types of products or services? Or are you targeting new customers who haven’t heard of your product or service yet?

Innovation processes: How does an inventor go from idea to product?
Invention processes can vary significantly depending on the inventor's background and experience. Generally, an inventor will need to generate a number of different ideas in order to come up with a product that is new and exciting. This might include generating concepts for products, working on prototypes, or even coming up with new business models.
One important factor that will affect the invention process is the inventor's willingness to risk failure. If the inventor feels that their idea is too risky or if they do not believe that it can be turned into a successful product, they will likely not go ahead with it. In addition, the inventor's skills and knowledge might also be needed in order to create a successful product.

The benefits of innovation
Innovation is a key aspect of business success. It allows businesses to improve their products and services, and provides them with new ideas for how to do things. In addition, innovation can help businesses capitalize on new technologies and updates to their own infrastructure. By improving the way that they use technology, businesses can save money and increase efficiency.
Innovation is also a key factor in creating jobs. By making improvements to their products or services, businesses can create new positions for people who are capable of doing work that once required an advanced degree or experience. Innovation also helps businesses increase production by making changes to their plants or methods of producing goods. In turn, this can lead to increased profits and more jobs overall.

Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

How to have big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. But, having big ideas is essential for innovation and progress. Here are a few ways to have big ideas:
1) Be curious and ask lots of questions. When you're curious about something, you're more likely to come up with new and interesting ideas about it. So, ask lots of questions and explore the things that interest you.

2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.
