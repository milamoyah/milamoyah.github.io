How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

Guidelines for creativity
Creativity is a Keyword for Today's World
There are many ways to be creative and some people believe that creativity is only found in the arts. Others believe that creativity can be found in any activity that leads to new ideas or solutions. The guidelines for being creative are as follows:

1. Be open to new ideas. This means that you should not be afraid to experiment with what you do, even if it does not seem fun or interesting at first. It can result in some great ideas that can help make your work more successful.

2. Allow yourself time and space to brainstorm. It takes time and effort to come up with new ideas, so don't try to do too much at once. Give yourself enough time so that you can come up with several good ones before having to choose one.
