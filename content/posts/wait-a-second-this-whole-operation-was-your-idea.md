Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

The future of innovation
The future of innovation is exciting, but it also has a lot of potential drawbacks. Many experts believe that innovation can be used to create new products and services that are more efficient, more affordable, or even more dangerous. However, these benefits often come with a cost – the creativity and ingenuity of the innovator is often required to come up with new ideas that can save people time, money, or even lives. If this process is not done right, the innovation could instead lead to danger and disaster.
