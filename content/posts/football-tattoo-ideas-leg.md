According to scientists, there are three ways to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers. The first way is to use a fermentation process that breaks down the cellulose in plants into glucose and carbon dioxide. The second way is to use a vacuum sealer that sucks clean air out of the fridge and stores food in airtight containers. The third way is to use an oven as a warming oven that cooks food until it becomes safe to eat. all three methods have their own pros and cons.
