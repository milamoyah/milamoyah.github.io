The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.

Creativity is an innate quality that many people take for granted. However, without effort, creativity can often be wasted. For example, if you're creative in your artwork but don't have any ideas for products, you may not be successful in business. To be successful, creativity must come from the inside out – with ideas and solutions rather than just pictures in your head.
