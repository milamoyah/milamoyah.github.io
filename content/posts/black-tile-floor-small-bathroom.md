The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information. It has been used in various ways such as for gaming, speech recognition, and more. 
One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence is its ability to learn quickly and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This makes it ideal for tasks such asAutonomous Patrols or airport security. Another advantage is its ability to improve our understanding of the world around us. For example, if you were looking for a restaurant, AI could help you find one that was close by or give you recommendations based on your interests.
