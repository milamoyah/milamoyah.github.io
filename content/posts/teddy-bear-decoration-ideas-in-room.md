What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives.

Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status.

But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.
