Basics: What are the different creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and forms, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether you’re looking to create an idea for your next project or just start thinking about new ways to improve your skills, there are some basic tips to get you started. Here are four quick ideas for getting started:
1. Take a walk around your city and think about what might be possible with different transportation options. What would a more efficient commute look like? What if the bridges and tunnels were repurposed as public art spaces? These are just a few examples of how creativity can be used in everyday life.

2. Make something using materials that you already have on hand. This could mean recycling materials such as old cans or cups, or finding new sources of inspiration from nature.

Invention as an event: What are some of the key steps in invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or idea. It can be something as simple as making a new recipe for cooking or designing a new shirt. The key to invention is coming up with an original concept that others can't come up with. There are many steps involved in coming up with a new product, but one of the most important is creating an idea. Once you have an idea, it's important to find someone who can help you develop it into a reality.
