What are the benefits of Blogging?
There are many benefits to blogging, including creating an online presence for your business, sharing your thoughts and ideas with others, and deepening the connection you have with your customers or followers. Here are four of the most popular benefits of blogging: 
1. Increased Visibility: When you start blogging, you become one of the “official” authors of your blog post. This gives other bloggers a higher chance of finding and reading your content, as well as potential customers who may be interested in what you have to say. 
2. Increased Exposure: Your blog posts will be seen by more people than if you wrote them all from scratch. Not only will this give you an audience that can potentially promote your brand or product, but it also leads to increased traffic and for website owners, more leads coming in from potential customers.

Overcoming blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. But don't worry, there are things you can do to overcome this block.
First, try to relax. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay if you can't think of anything right now. It happens to everyone. Just take a break for a few minutes and come back later.

If relaxation doesn't work, try brainstorming. Write down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how silly they may seem. Once you have a list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and developing them further.

If all else fails, talk to someone else about your project. Sometimes it helps to hear someone else's perspective on what you're trying to write about. They might have some good ideas that you can use.
