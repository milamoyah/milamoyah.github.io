What is the definition of innovation?
The definition of innovation has been debated for years and there is no definitive answer. In general, innovation refers to a new approach to something or a new way of doing something. Innovations have the potential to change the way people live and work, and can even improve the quality of life for those who use them. However, there are some key elements that must be satisfied in order for an innovation to be considered successful: it needs to be novel, it needs to be affordable, it needs to be accessible, it needs to be viable, and it needs to be safe.
